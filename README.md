=====

Design Principles and Methods (ECSE 211) is a design class at McGill. In it, we use the LeJOS platform to perform 5 labs (above), which lead into a larger 6 week project.

This year, our main propject is to design a Robot which will play a 'Capture the Flag' game. It has to avoid obstacles to get to find a block, pick up said block and return it to a specified square.

Teams are graded on the speed this task is performed
